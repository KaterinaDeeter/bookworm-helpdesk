  <p>The Bookworm Helpdesk is a project meant to help those who struggle with technology in an easily accessible space.
     Access to technology in itself is a large issue, but it compounds when those with the access are unable to use their
     technology. The ability to understand and use technology is often overlooked, and this is something that also should 
     be addressed. The goal of the bookworm helpdesk is to provide help with technology in a space that is easy to reach. 
     Libraries are open to everyone, just as the digital space should be.
